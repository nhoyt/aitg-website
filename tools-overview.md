DRES, a division of the College of Applied Health Sciences (AHS) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, has been involved with designing and developing software tools for accessibility since the early 2000's. The main tools it has developed are:

* [Functional Accessibility Evaluator (FAE)](/tools/fae) for evaluating websites
* [AInspector WCAG](/tools/ainspector-wcag), a Firefox browser extension
* [A11yFirst for CKEditor](/tools/a11yfirst), used for CMS content authoring
* [Accessibility Bookmarklets](/tools/accessibility-bookmarklets), developed in conjunction with Pixo

The first two, FAE and AInspector WCAG share the same rulesets and evaluation engine (aka evaluation library), but differ in other important ways.

FAE is a web application that evaluates entire websites and generates multiple levels of reports based on the way that evaluation rules are categorized. These reports can be saved for future reference by registering for an account.

AInspector WCAG is a Firefox browser add-on that evaluates a single page and provides results that can be navigated, again based on rule categories, in the browser sidebar. The results, however, are not readily archivable.

The A11yFirst for CKEditor project seeks to transform the web content authoring model from reactive to proactive, by creating an authoring environment that supports accessibility by default.

The Accessibility Bookmarklets provide web developers and designers with ways of visualizing accessibility features and information that is otherwise hidden on the page. They do not evaluate the page based on accessibility requirements or rules, but are very useful for performing certain types of manual checks.
