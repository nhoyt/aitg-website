AInspector WCAG is an add-on for the Firefox browser that, when activated, automatically analyzes the page loaded in the active tab for compliance with accessibility requirements defined by the [World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)](https://www.w3.org/), and for proper use of accessibility features defined by the current HTML Standard (previously known as HTML5).

## Web Accessibility Standards

Each evaluation rule that AInspector WCAG uses is based on one or more of the requirements and features from the following widely-accepted standards:

* [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/) Success Criteria
* [Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA)](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/)
* [WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/) Techniques
* [HTML Standard](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/)

## OpenAjax Evaluation Library

AInspector WCAG and the companion tool, the [Functional Accessibility Evaluator (FAE)](/tools/fae), both use the OpenAjax Evaluation Library rules and rulesets.

One of the distinguishing features of OpenAjax Evaluation Library is that it not only produces evaluation results for accessibility requirements that can be programmatically analyzed, but also results that call out elements on the page that need to be manually checked to determine compliance.

## Installation

You can install the latest version of AInspector WCAG directly into Firefox by visiting the [Mozilla Add-ons page](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ainspector-wcag/).
