FAE is a web application that analyzes web pages for compliance with accessibility requirements defined by the [World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)](https://www.w3.org/), and features in the current HTML Standard, previously known as HTML5.

The specifications for these requirements and features include:

* [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/) Success Criteria
* [Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA)](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/)
* [WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/) Techniques
* [HTML Standard](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/)

FAE and the companion tool, [AInspector WCAG for Firefox](/tools/ainspector), both use the OpenAjax Evaluation Library rules and rulesets. Every rule included in the library references at least one WCAG 2.0 Level A or AA Success Criterion requirement.

These rules and rulesets were developed over a six year period through the work of the OpenAjax Accessibility Task Force and feedback from users of FAE and AInspector WCAG.

The OpenAjax Evaluation Library includes two rulesets, selectable by the user:

* HTML5 and ARIA Techniques
* HTML4 Legacy Techniques

The recommended ruleset is HTML5 and ARIA Techniques, as it comprises the most up-to-date requirements.

FAE is designed to be used in conjunction with [AInspector WCAG for Firefox](/tools/ainspector) and the [Accessibility Bookmarklets](/tools/accessibility-bookmarklets) to help people gain a comprehensive understanding of the accessibility features, issues and potential issues of a web resource.
